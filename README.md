# AI-Health-App

## [About the Project](#about-the-project)
This is an AI-based Health App to predict the risk of heart disease and offer personal health analysis by monitoring health vitals recorded from wearables.

> This app, originally called HAMS (Health AI Monitoring System). was developed by a team of Biomedical engineering students as a capstone project at the University of Victoria, the HAMS app uses machine learning and trends analysis algorithms to predict health outcomes using wearables data and a brief user survey.
> It is our hope that this app can be a useful proof-of-concept for future development and advancement in the field of personalized healthcare.

After graduation, @ChristineWC and I (@wanyingtian) continued to develop the Health App to reach higher potential.
